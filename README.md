Final project for AYTS5001 – Programming for Analytics (FIFA 24 Player Stats Analysis)

Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the FIFA 24 Player Stats Dataset from Kaggle.
It contains over 5,600 players with 40+ technical, physical, and mental attributes, plus basic information such as age, nationality, club, and market value.

Objectives

The aim of this assignment was to:
	•	Load, clean, and prepare the dataset using Python and Pandas
	•	Analyse different player performance attributes
	•	Explore which technical or physical attributes are most strongly linked to finishing ability
	•	Create visualisations to support the analysis
	•	Produce a short set of conclusions based on the results

Results
	•	Finishing has the strongest correlations with long shots, shot power, and dribbling
	•	Speed attributes (acceleration, sprint speed) show weak relationships with finishing
	•	Market value is influenced by multiple offensive attributes, not one single skill
	•	Additional analysis included a new technical_skill feature, a simple regression model, and a positional comparison
