Final project for AYTS5001 – Programming for Analytics (FIFA 24 Player Stats Analysis)

Dataset

The dataset from Kaggle (“FIFA 24 Player Stats Dataset”) has over 5,600 rows (players) and more than 40 columns covering different performance attributes.

Objectives
The aim of this assignment was to analyse the dataset using Python and explore the various player performance attributes to try and predict a player’s finishing ability, as well as identify any other correlations that might be linked to a player’s skills or value.

Results
- Finishing ability has a strong correlation to technical shooting skills: The strongest correlations with finishing came from long shots, shot power, and dribbling.
- Speed contributes far less to finishing than expected: Both acceleration and sprint speed showed a very weak relationship with finishing.
- Market value comes from a combination of offensive skills, not just one: Value didn’t have a very strong correlation with any single attribute, which suggests that clubs look for players with all-round attacking ability, not just finishing.
